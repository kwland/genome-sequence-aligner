   * Shot-selection AI backed by a persistent particle filter over complete
   * fleet configurations.
   *
   * A "particle" is one complete, internally consistent guess at where the
   * whole fleet is: every ship in the fleet gets a placement, no two ships
   * overlap, and (once observations exist) every hit cell is covered and no
   * miss cell is covered. The AI maintains a population of these particles
   * across the whole game -- filtering, not rebuilding, it after each shot
   * -- and derives its move purely from what fraction of surviving
   * particles agree on each cell. This never needs to *decide* which ship a
   * run of hits belongs to (the failure mode of a simpler capped-run
   * heuristic once ships touch and their hit-runs merge): particles
   * representing every remaining consistent interpretation stay alive side
   * by side, weighted implicitly by how many valid whole-fleet completions
   * support each one, and contradictory interpretations die out on their
   * own as more of the board is revealed -- there is never a point where
   * the AI commits to a wrong belief it can't recover from.
   *
   * Per shot:
   *   1. Filter -- drop particles inconsistent with any new hit/miss.
   *   2. Resample -- if too few particles survive, construct fresh ones
   *      consistent with *all* evidence so far (covers every hit, avoids
   *      every miss) to refill the population. Sampling reuses candidate
   *      pools precomputed once per resample rather than rejecting blind
   *      guesses, so refilling stays fast even late-game.
   *   3. Score -- three probability maps, not one:
   *        occupancy[cell]  = fraction of particles with *any* ship at cell.
   *        activeShip[cell] = fraction of particles where `cell` belongs to
   *                           a ship that has >=1 hit and >=1 still-unknown
   *                           cell in that particle (i.e. a ship that's
   *                           been found but not finished).
   *        sink[cell]       = fraction of particles where `cell` is the
   *                           *only* remaining unknown cell of such a ship
   *                           (firing here would sink it in that
   *                           hypothesis).
   *      If any activeShip mass exists, target mode: score cells by
   *      4*activeShip + 2*sink + 0.5*occupancy. Otherwise hunt mode: score
   *      by occupancy + 0.10*informationGain, where informationGain uses
   *      4*p*(1-p) as a cheap proxy for how much firing at a cell (roughly
   *      50/50 to hit) would narrow the hypothesis space -- a one-step
   *      lookahead in spirit without the cost of actually re-filtering the
   *      whole population once per candidate cell.
   *
   * Simplifications made deliberately for a board this size: "resampling"
   * regenerates fresh particles via constrained random construction rather
   * than mutating survivors (simpler, and cheap enough here that true
   * MCMC-style mutation isn't needed); informationGain is an analytic
   * entropy proxy rather than a literal two-branch expected-value
   * simulation. Coefficients above are reasonable defaults, tunable via
   * self-play.

 * the complete enemy fleet, an action is a shot, and the observation is
 * miss/hit/sunk. POMCP samples a possible hidden fleet at the root of each
 * simulation and uses UCT/PUCT tree search over future action-observation
 * histories. This implementation is specialized for the 8x12 board and uses
 * a compact particle belief plus exact sunk-ship announcements from app.js.
